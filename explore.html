            Travelling is something that teaches a person many things as one can have many interactions with strangers and can help one learn many new things about him as well. I had a magical experience during my journey to United States of America. My main aim or my mission for going to America was for an educational purpose. I wanted to know more about the country and wanted to explore it. I had visited America in the year 2007. It was ten days school trip. I really enjoyed my trip with my friends and I also got to learn many new things on my trip. We were also accompanied by our professors. My trip was basically based an educational based. They were very helpful and cheerful. We visited Washington DC, New York and Florida. The experience was great and thrilling. We visited many important landmarks, museums and also many memorials. These places would help me know more about the history of America. </p>
