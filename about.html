        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>Adventure tourism is a type of tourism in which tourists engage in adventure activities such as trekking, climbing, rafting, scuba diving, or the likes. Adventure tourism gains much of its excitement by allowing the tourist to step outside their comfort zone.
            Adventure tourists may have the motivation to achieve mental states characterized as rush or flow, resulting from stepping outside their comfort zone. This may be from experiencing culture shock or by performing acts requiring significant effort and involve some degree of risk, real or perceived, or physical danger. This may include activities such as mountaineering, trekking, bungee jumping, mountain biking, cycling, canoeing, scuba diving, rafting, kayaking, zip-lining, paragliding, hiking, exploring, Geocaching, canyoneering, sandboarding, caving and rock climbing. Some obscure forms of adventure travel include disaster and ghetto tourism. Other rising forms of adventure travel include social and jungle tourism.

                <p> Adventure tourism primarily focuses on participating in physical activities that go above and beyond standard tourist experiences and frequently contain an element of risk or thrill.‍Adventure tourism allows visitors to explore and interact with the natural environment in ways that test their physical and mental capacities. Trekking, hiking, mountaineering, rock climbing, white-water rafting, paragliding, bungee jumping, scuba diving, wildlife safaris, caving, skiing, and other activities are common.

                <p>A bi-product of travel is raising your self-awareness and it's one of the most beneficial parts of taking on an adventurous trip overseas. Adventure travel brings you closer to your “inner self”, giving you the chance to examine and challenge yourself in ways you didn't think were possible.
